Final project- Machine Learning course
- **This project is a part of the "Machine learning- SBE452- Spring 2020" Course, Systems and Biomedical Engineering Department, Cairo University, 4th year (Senior year).**

We applied traditional machine learning techniques in building independent binary classifiers for detecting pneumonia.
The proposed algorithm consists of three main stages, the first stage involves the preprocessing pipeline. Then, the feature extraction stage using the lbp histograms of the preprocessed images. In the third stage, we trained the data using two classifiers and used a voting classifier at the end to select the best model.
